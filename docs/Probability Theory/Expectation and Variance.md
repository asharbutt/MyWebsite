# Expectation - Introduction
Let X be a random variable on a probability space ($$\Omega$$, $$\digamma$$, P). We are interested to know what the average value X may take over a range of experiments given the probability of each of those outcomes. 

When $$\Omega$$ is finite and X is discrete (countable), then this is simple:

$$EX =  \ \sum_{w \in \Omega}^{} P(w)X(w) \$$

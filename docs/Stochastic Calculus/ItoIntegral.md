# Ito Integral
General integrals are quite easy to work out because the functions are differentiable, and we can use theory to split up the intergrals into smaller and smaller sections in order to calculate the values. However, an Ito Integral is one that is being integrated with respect to a Brownian Motion, for example:

$$\int_{0}^{t} \Delta (u) ,\dW$$

# Radon-Nikodym Theorem
When 2 measures are equivalent, we know that both measures agree with what is not possible i.e if $$\mu(A) = 0$$ then $$\nu(A) = 0$$ as well. Another way of saying this is that $$\nu$$ is absolutely continious with respect to $$\mu$$ i.e. $$\nu \ll \mu$$.

The Radon-Nikodym theorem states that for 2 equivalent measures on a space, there exists a non-negative function/variable Z such that EZ = 1 and:

$$\nu(A) = \int_{A}^{} Z(w)d\mu$$
